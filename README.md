## Python Learning Notes

This section contains my **personal learning exercises** in Python, unrelated to the main threat evaluation project.  
It includes experiments with:

- `if` statements for decision making
- Understanding variable types (string, integer)
- Basic nested logic
- Preparing the mindset for more advanced threat evaluation coding

These exercises serve as **practice and skill-building** before implementing full system logic.
